## Introduction
According to [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Survive-a-Plane-Crash):

The chances of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1. That said, a lot can go wrong at 33,000 feet (10,058.4 m) above the ground, and if youâ€™re unlucky enough to be aboard when something does, the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death. Almost 95% of airplane crashes have survivors, so even if the worst does happen, your odds aren't as bad as you might think

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the dataset and visualize the data to find some weird or interesting insights.
However we will also try to find answers to the following questions:
- How many planes crashed yearly?
- How many people were aboard?
- what is the number of crashes by operator?
- what is the number of crashes by the type of aircraft?
- How is the airplane crash geographically distributed?

## Data Sourcing
This Dataset was created on Kaggle in September 2016 but the original version was hosted by Open Data by Socrata at:
https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq(no longer available). The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.

Data:  Data can be accessed from this link  https://aka.ms/30DLDATGitHubRepo Locate project folder and download the csv file.
The dataset contains 5268 rows and 13 colums.
